            <p>SVNCRWNS partnered with Noisy Tenants to produce the THUG MYTH Documentary.  This initiative was inspired following the death of Freddie Gray and the Baltimore Uprising.   We interviewed over 20 men asking them self-reflective questions as it relates to their identity and how they feel theyâ€™re portrayed in media. Are you a THUG?
